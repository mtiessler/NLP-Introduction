# The ðŸ¤— NLP Course

This repo contains a summary from the **[Hugging Face NLP course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1/1)**. 

The course teaches you about applying Transformers to various tasks in natural language processing and beyond. Along the way, you'll learn how to use the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) ecosystem â€” [ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers), [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets), [ðŸ¤— Tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers), and [ðŸ¤— Accelerate](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) â€” as well as the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

## ðŸ“” Jupyter notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks containing all the code from the course are hosted on the [`huggingface/notebooks`](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks) repo. If you wish to generate them locally, first install the required dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following script:

```bash
python utils/generate_notebooks.py --output_dir nbs
```

If you use *venv* remember to install a new kernel into your jupyter lab/notebook: 


```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=nlp-course-venv
```
This script extracts all the code snippets from the chapters and stores them as notebooks in the `nbs` folder.
